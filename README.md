[Map?](https://reidka2909.github.io/2019_US_pop/)<br></br>
There are no errors in any of my consoles (Firefox, Chrome, and Explorer), but the map on my server does not show circles.
### Map Message & Application
This map could send a message that the size of the state does not dictate or even correlate with the population. California and Texas
are high in both categories, but the other states correspond between these two factors. For example, Alaska is the largest state with
a third to last population ranking. This map could be applied to exemplify the number of electoral votes a state has or why a state
receive less federal funding. Maps are very good at showing where things are and where resources should go. In this pandemic, with cases on the rise, 
the factor of population can be considered in the allocation of resources such as staff, supplies and money.
The circles are not meant to be used as geographical references, but as visual and psychological guidance of the 
thematic layer of 2019 state population estimates.
